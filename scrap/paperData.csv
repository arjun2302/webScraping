"Embedded Systems for the IoT","On the fringes of the Future Internet and making it happen The Internet of Things (IoT) will be an open network in which self-organized or intelligent entities will be interoperable and able to act independently depending on the context. Embedded Systems (ES), as IoT components, will have an important role in this concept. These technologies will underlie relevant applications for smart cities. The Workshop is an opportunity to review and query some of the key projects in these research areas. Format of the workshop The Workshop will be introduced by the session organizers, briefly describing the motivation for the session and its objectives. It will consist of four 15 minute presentations from EU projects, 2 funded under the ARTEMIS umbrella, two under FP7 ICT. The first two dealing with embedded systems research and development and the last two deal with applications. The Workshop will end with a panel discussion that will comprise the 4 speakers plus the two session organizers who will act as dynamizers of the discussion.
